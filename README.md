## TODO

- Make hypertext serializer only return url if its registered or id if not(so we dont have to add empty resources for each pk)
- Add filter query to list api
- Add fields to csv content type of list api(this might not work)
- Validate order,filter,fields by walking the schema
- Add options request to each resource returning schema information
- Added exclude/include to register so users can block secrets
- Add permissions to register which override the defaults
- Add permissions default setting and use it for all
- Add Reports setting which takes report name, query parameters, and interval.  This creates new endpoints such as .../reports/<slug> which is a CSV
- Create warehousing tasks which run a stored report on a interview and save that into a warehouse or lake(SQL db vs. parquet/csv in s3)
- Create barebones Reports user interace for creating, sharing, and updating them via the website.
